// Standalone script to fix missing memberships
// Run with: flutter run bin/fix_memberships.dart
// (Actually better to embed this logic in a temporary UI button or run it in main for a sec, 
// as standalone dart scripts dont have the flutter environment/auth context easily unless hardcoded)

// STRATEGY: 
// 1. We will add a temporary button in Profile Screen (or Home) that calls this "fix" logic.
// 2. OR even better, I can just write a function in the repository and ask the user to call it via a new temporary FAB (Floating Action Button) on the home screen.

/*
 But since I am an agent, I can create a new file `lib/fix_data.dart` with a main function? 
 No, `flutter run` needs an app. 
 
 I will create a temporary screen `lib/features/debug/fix_memberships_screen.dart` and route to it, 
 OR just modify `HomeScreen` to call the fix on init?
 
 Modify `CommunityRepository` to have a `fixMemberships` method and call it from `HomeScreen.initState`.
 That's the most reliable way to run it in the app context.
